For this final week, I decided to sift through Amalia Skarlatou Levi's twitter feed to find data through the transgender archives. I wanted a set of data that could be OCRed, so I selected just 'clippings' in the 'refine your search' area. 

This narrowed my search, but there were still way too many archives for extracting and cleaning. I selected the 'topics' option to refine my search into just one category. I wanted a topic that was both interesting in terms of transgenders and also the right amount of data for suitable cleaning.

When first looking at the clippings with the topic of war, the clippings were very old and a lot of them were very bad images. I knew from the beginning that cleaning this data with OCR would be a struggle. 

The first process that I did was OCRing the data in R Studio from week 2, the clippings were saved onto my desktop where then I followed the steps highlighted on the CDH website. The process was relatively short and easy in R Studio and once that was done, txt files were them created and saved onto my computer for each document, totalling around 30 documents. 

Now that I extracted the data from the digital transgender archive website, it was time to clean up the data. The second process that I did was cleaning up the data using Sublime Text while completing it with tools learned from Regex. The data was cleaned up by eliminating unwanted symbols and re-arranging the format if OCR messed it up. The 'Find & Replace' was used to eliminate several symbols in one occurrence.

Once the data was extracted and cleaned from the past two steps. The third step was looking at all the data by creating my own corpus in Voyant Tools. This tool gives a greater image of data as a whole and provides a visual aspect to look at trends and similarities in the data. 

Once these three steps have been completed, the method to finally share the data that I chose is to put it on the static website I created. This website was created in week 5 and is a great tool for sharing data to a large audience.

When comparing the data set that I was analyzing with Michelle's data set, Michelle had a lot more information to extract and clean. Her process of putting the raw data into final form must have been very messy and time-consuming.

When dealing with digital history it is said that 80% of the work is just dipping our toes in and getting farmiliar with the messy data. When looking back at this week's tasks and Michelle's work, I can be conclude that is 100% true.
