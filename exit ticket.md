# Exit Ticket

As I was going through the available spring courses for selection, I came across HIST 3814. When I first read the course description, I thought it was especially interesting as the concept of a methods course was uncharted territory for me during university. Even though I am not a history student, the history courses I have previously taken have refined my literature and writing skills. Being an economics student, I suspected that the tools learned throughout this course could translate to some of the analytical problems in my field. 

My starting position before the course, was that I have taken numerous history courses before, although when taking a first glance at the course calendar, most of the assignments and terms were foreign to me. When starting this course, this terrified me. I wasn't sure if others were in the same boat, or I was the only one in this situation. Luckily, this course was set up great, with the discord, I found out others had the same problems I was experiencing navigating the weekly assignments.

Throughout these past six weeks, I have grown immensely from an academic point of view. The tools and thought processes necessary for successful digital historians have opened my eyes to a whole different field that I may pursue. I did achieve several successes during this course, particularly in Week 4, with Excel & R, Voyant Tools, and Topic Models. Additionally, the applications and skills used during Week 4 could be translated for different courses in a variety of disciplines. Another success that I achieved were the tasks during Week 5, I did fairly well during this week and the applications used will be applied towards my education in the future. A glorious failure I did endure was during Week 2, as it was my first time using a coding application, so the tasks were difficult for my rookie brain at the time.

What I loved about this course was the community feeling of it, the Discord made it accessible to talk to others about the course material. Often if I was having a problem with one of the tasks, I would comb through the Discord, and more often than not, I was able to find the solution as a fellow classmate often had similar problems. I did personal message several classmates regarding problems with the material, where we would bounce ideas of one another for a final solution. Another person who made a difference for me during this course was my Father, he is a data analyst who often uses R Studio, while he wanted me to familiarize myself with this useful tool as much as possible, if I did encounter any issues, he was always a tool in my back pocket.As I was going through the available spring courses for selection, I came across HIST 3814.

I do believe the applications could be utilized throughout the rest of my university education, as well as during my professional career. Myself being an economics student, will most likely have to use R Studio or another similar coding application, which I now have a head start on!

My understanding of this subject matter now compared to the beginning of May is night and day, I have grown so much as a digital historian in which these skills will be put to use for future decades. Before this course started, I had no idea what digital history was, I actually had to google what it was, and even then I was still puzzled by the definition!

The key moment where things came together was during Week 6, where we used the skills to create a mini digital history assignment. Tools from different weeks were utilized to create a piece of work, then tools from Week 5 were used to finally be a method for sharing such work. In the future, I would love to complete more assignments like during Week 6 and utilize different applications for a complete digital history project. 

Finally, from where I started in this course to where I now stand amazes me. The knowledge consumed regarding this topic has been immense. I strongly believe I deserve an A- for this course for my hard work.
